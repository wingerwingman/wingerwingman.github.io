I originally went to college for web design and was offered a position in the IT department for the school. That eventually led me into a network engineer position and software engineering positions. I really enjoyed the designing of the infostructure’s but really didn’t enjoy the break fix as much. I learned that 90% of my job was break fix with some of the design aspect I enjoy so I decided to make a change.
I have been dealing with code from all types of applications for my entire career and feel I would enjoy designing the software myself instead of just fixing it. That is what has brought me here. I want a very thorough understanding of software engineering and feel this is the best way to get that understanding.
